                Russia's Luna-25 faces technical glitch:<br> Report
                Chandrayaan-3 versus Lune-25 live updates: Russia's national sp<br>ace agency Roskosmos 
                reported that Russia's Luna-25 spacecraft faced a<br>n "abnormal situation" on Saturday as it 
                was preparing to transfer to its p<br>re-landing orbit.
                The Russian spacecraft is expected to land on the south<br> pole of the moon on August 21 - two
                 days ahead of ISRO's Chandrayaan-<br>3 landing on August 23.
                "During the operation, an abnormal situation occ<br>urred on board the automatic station, 
                which did not allow the manoeuvre <br>to be performed with the specified parameters," Roskosmos 
                said in a short<br>statement. Specialists are analysing the situation, it said, without
                 providing<br>further details, reported Reuters.</p><br>
         
         
            <p id="para5">
                <b> What next to happen, explains ex-ISRO scientist</b> <br> 
                "A major event is the 4800 N Thrusters. They have to fire 
                to take it to the l<br>ower orbit. That will also be done in two
                steps (first completed yesterday)<br> and ensuring that all the 
                systems are working properly these two steps will<br> go down,
                put a 100-kilometre orbit. Then from 100 go to the 30-kilometre<br>
                orbit... that's very very vital," Former Indian Space Research
                Organisation<br> (ISRO) scientist, Mylswamy Annadurai said while 
                speaking to ANI.He fu<br>rther said that the position of the module
                has to be ascertained properly. So<br> then from the 30 kilometre
                onwards, how to move, how to thrust to fire, wh<br>at orientation 
                to fire, and whether along it will reduce the velocity in the
                hor<br>izontal. Then it has to composite vertical also it has to
                vertical fall, also it ha<br>s to reduce. So that way a lot of
                manoeuvres to be done. And while doing it,<br>it has to make
                sure that it is going on the proper path. So already loaded
                pict<br>ures of the lunar terrain will be there. Check against
                that and try to identify t<br>he place where it's supposed to land.
                It is also supposed to have been already<br>loaded in the system.
                "So all these activities will be done by the lander. The l<br>ander
                will start its real action.
