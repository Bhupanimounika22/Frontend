            <p>Chandrayaan-3 LIVE: The Indian Space Research Organisation  (ISRO) has shared new updates on 
                its historic mission Chandraya-an-3 as the spacecraft inches closer to the Moon gradually.  Chandrayaan-3 will make its first soft landing attempt to the Moon's south pole region on
                23 August. At present, the Lander module of Chandrayaan-3, comprising Vikram lander and
                Pragyan rover, after a successful deboosting reduced their orbit to 113 km x 157 km.
                The second and final deboosting operation has also been successfully completed.  </p>
